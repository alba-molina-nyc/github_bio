# I am passionate about making people's lives easier through technology.

### Who am I?

I have 5+ years of software sales experience and 2+ years of managing other people like me. I've worked in small and medium-sized companies and enjoy working at hyper growth startups.

I was always the sales person that stayed behind to talk to the software developers at the places I worked at to learn more about the technology and how things work. I took my first python class in 2020 and in September 2021 I officially enrolled in a software-engineering bootcamp, General Assembly where I learned to code in Python and JavaScript.

Since then I interned for three months at mPulse Mobile as a Data Engineer mostly working in Python 3.9, Postgresql, and Airflow.


I am currently taking Computer Science classes at [Binghamton](https://www.binghamton.edu/watson/about/) (my alma mater) Watson School of Engineering, including:
- [Intro to Java](https://www.binghamton.edu/watson/continuing-education/data-science/java.html)
- [Intro to Computer Networks](https://www.binghamton.edu/watson/continuing-education/data-science/intro-to-computer-networks.html)
- [Advanced Algorithms](https://www.binghamton.edu/watson/continuing-education/data-science/advanced-algorithms.html)
- [Python Programming Level 2](https://www.binghamton.edu/watson/continuing-education/data-science/python-programming-level-2.html
)

### Values I deeply care about

- `Humility`: I am confident in general but when it comes to engineering I will always default to being painfully humble. Switching gears starting all the way from the bottom again is humbling.
- `Customer Obsession`: not a shocker since I started my career out of college in a customer facing role. I care deeply about going the extra mile for customers and building products that start with research and customer need
- `Clarity & Consistency`: say what you mean and mean what you say. I am always striving to bringing clarity and consistency between my words and my subsequent related behaviors and actions
- `Growth Mindset`- I am always looking to learn and discover ways of doing things better and faster.
